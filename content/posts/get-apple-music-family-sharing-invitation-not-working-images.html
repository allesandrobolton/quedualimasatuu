                Jul 2, 2015 on your family member&#039;s device, make sure their account is signed in for. Once set up, you can share content purchased from itunes. My husband signed up for a family apple music plan and sent invitations to our family members.
    </p>

    <h3>Music, movies, books, tv shows, as well besides, apple is constantly working on adding new subscription services such as the recently launched apple news+ and apple tv+, and much anticipated and apple arcade.</h3>
    <p>In my family sharing settings i still see the invite as sent and when i open itunes on his windows machine there is no indication that there is apple music family invite. If your family members have already signed up for an apple music free trial, the above settings will not work. My husband signed up for a family apple music plan and sent invitations to our family members. You can, with apple family sharing!</p>
