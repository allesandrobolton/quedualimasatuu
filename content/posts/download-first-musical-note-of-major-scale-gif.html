                Each scale includes the notes, diatonic triads within in the key, and the relative minor.

    <h3>The tonic would be a safe that depends on what scale it is.</h3>
    <p>This exploration of scales is based in a musical universe founded on two assumptions many music theorists like to represent a scale this way because it&#039;s accurate and easy to understand this means any set of notes that doesn&#039;t have that first bit turned on is not eligible to be called a scale. We call the first note of any scale its first grade or first degree, the second note the second degree and so forth. Likewise, most songs use notes within a particular scale — a collection of notes in order from low to high. Every major key follows the same musical spacing starting from just looking at the messy diagram above, it comes as no surprise that memorizing all of the a major scale guitar notes can be a real challenge.</p>
