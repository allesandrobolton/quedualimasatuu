    <p>In english usage a note is also the sound itself. I tried singing along to these videos to see where i would hit my bottom and top note, but each singer had different voices so it was difficult to for me hear the real note and could you guys me help out in any way in finding some sort of app or website that can tell me both the note and octave i was singing? That signal is then interpreted by our tool and the frequency of that sound is deciphered and displayed along with the corresponding musical note. Enter some of the notes you want or even a chord or two.</p>
