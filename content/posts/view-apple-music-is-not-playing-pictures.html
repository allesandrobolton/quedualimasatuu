    <p><strong>View Apple Music Is Not Playing Pictures</strong>. Apple music says not playing? I see that you&#039;re not able to play songs after starting your apple music trial.</p>

                I finally got apple music to play music again by erasing all settings and content and then not restoring my icloud backup. No one else has had any luck with anything else? You&#039;re logged into apple music, but some songs won&#039;t play.
    </p>

    <h3>However, when i click play, the flac music will not play.</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, however, itunes seems to forget that you&#039;re authorized your mac must be authorized for every apple id used to purchase music that you want to play. From issues with playlists, songs disappearing, difficulty playing offline, syncing and more. It will play some songs in my library and that is it. Even add them to my music and replay it while it is still playing.</p>
