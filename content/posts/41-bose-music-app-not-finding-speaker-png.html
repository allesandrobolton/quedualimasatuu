                You&#039;ll be able to switch to google assistant in the once it is installed, you&#039;ll find the setting to switch to google assistant under the voice settings in the bose music app. Bose music app does not detect product. But soundtouch is a complete ecosystem found in many of our products, including home cinema.

    <h3>I have tried following troubleshooting but the issue not yet resolved.</h3>
    <p>You can enjoy wireless freedom for up to 7 hours of music playback! If i turn off the speaker or disconnect from my wifi when i reconnect and turn back on the app on my iphone cant find my i have also downloaded the app on my laptop which seems to find the speakers everytime with ease. Bose speakers are also great, but again, not for the sound quality. I opened bluetooth and hear music i can hear.</p>
