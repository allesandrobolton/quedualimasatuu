    <p><strong>Get Music Note Stem Rules Background</strong>. Stem direction is determined automatically, but you can manually change the stem direction of individual notes, chords, or of an entire voice. In dorico pro, the stem direction of notes and chords follows rules that are based on the conventions of music engraving.</p>

                Basically, that&#039;s a note or unpitched. How to use osmdcolor ? The normal rule in common notation is that, for any line of music, the notes and rests in each measure must add up to exactly the amount in the time signature, no more and no less.
    </p>

    <h3>As a rule, any notes at or above the b line on the staff have downward pointing stems, those notes below the b line have upward pointing stems.</h3>
    <p>But note stem direction isn&#039;t always as simple as that. The ending and the stem. Notes on a keyboard or piano. Experimenting in search of better defaults with sibelius&#039;s engraving rules, adjusting slurs that in her music notation reference behind bars, (how many times do we begin a sentence that way?) elaine gould says, when outer notes have opposite stem directions, move the slur at the stem end.</p>

        <p>If i select the g and press x to flip it to the other side of the stem, the stem direction changes to upwards and cannot thereafter be changed back to downwards (voice 2 is set to have stems downward by default).</p>
