                If you are one of them who are facing this issue on your android smartphone. I also have a samsung galaxy s7, which works perfectly with both it seems as though streaming services are syncing fine with your headphones however your personal library of music is having issues. I also have google drive running on my computer, this syncs my entire music folder to my drive.
    </p>

    <h3>Google play music provides cloud storage for up to 50,000 songs, accessible from both your desktop and your phone.</h3>
    <p>Rather than uploading your music to google drive, use google play music. Google apps not syncing with your android phone? Not receiving mails or other notifications? I&#039;ve tried looking this up a bit, but haven&#039;t come up with anything i&#039;m sure someone knows and uses google play musc.</p>
