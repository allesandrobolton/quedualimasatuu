                When you add a song to your library from apple music, it doesn&#039;t mean that you automatically want to download that song to your device too. Apple music lets you add songs whenever you want (see the method above on how to go about doing so). No nsfw content (some leeway may be given for album art or for other circumstances outside of the user&#039;s control).

    <p>My full apple music library only has about 3500 songs which can easily fit on my 256gb iphone 7 plus, but the music app on ios 10 only lets you. I was listening to a downloaded song, while surfing this was not only downloaded songs, but also ones added to my music but not downloaded. A new song from that artist you love has just come out and you try to download it onto your device. Why is my apple music not downloading?</p>
