                It was one of the things people found that worked really well. I logged into google play from my device and i am able install apps to the new device. I used the same google account i used on the ssamsung.
    </p>

    <h3>Users would love google play music since they can upload and listen to up to 50,000 songs from their personal libraries at no cost only if they have a standard account.</h3>
    <p>I used the same google account i used on the ssamsung. How come its not showing up on the s3 music player? Transfer your music from google play music to youtube music through their apps or on desktop. I had an album i purchased where only 9 of the 10 songs were showing up on my iphone in music.</p>
