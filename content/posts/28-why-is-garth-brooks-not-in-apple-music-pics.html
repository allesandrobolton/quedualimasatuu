                Troyal garth brooks (born february 7, 1962) is an american country music singer and songwriter. There are a lot of remakes of his songs but no originals. But garth brooks refuses to let his music be played on spotify.
    </p>

    <h3>His love for wife trisha yearwood is adorable, not to mention they are one of country music&#039;s hottest power couples.</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of remakes of his songs but no originals. Garth has said in the past that the reason his music is not on itunes nor spotify at least last that i heard, is because he feels that his albums should be played in their entirety and does not want people picking out certain songs as then. Now, garth brooks — yes, the man who thought chris gaines was a good idea — is looking to change the industry for the better and reinvigorate music sales with the launch of his new website, ghosttunes.com. Join country icons @garthbrooks and @trishayearwood in garth &amp; trisha live!</p>
