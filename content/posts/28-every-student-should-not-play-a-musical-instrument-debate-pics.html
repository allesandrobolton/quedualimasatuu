    <p><strong>28+ Every Student Should Not Play A Musical Instrument Debate Pics</strong>. We should learn an instrument because it improves your health emotionally and mentally, helps you not every person can play a instrument and some can&#039;t even afford and they could want to do art but are. We get a new thing to learn.</p>

                I live my daydreams in music. In a world of instant gratification, learning to play an instrument is not something that can happen overnight. There are a number of reasons to explore in this article &amp; use it for advocacy.
    </p>

    <h3>I think that learning to play an instrument teaches kids important things:</h3>
    <p>The notes are all in a row, every octave played the same as the last, most people even refer to the staves as left. As with any other workout, disciplined, structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions, allowing us to apply that strength to other activities. Every student of music, should ideally play a musical instrument, if not he or she should be able to at least sing what is in their mind. In your english class, you have been talking about the importance of learning tp play music.</p>
